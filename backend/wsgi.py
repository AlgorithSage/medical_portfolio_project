    from app import create_app
    app = create_app()
    ```

#### **Step 2: Push Your Project to GitHub**
Render deploys directly from a GitHub repository. If you haven't done so already, you need to upload your project.

1.  Create a new, empty repository on your GitHub account.
2.  In your VS Code terminal (from the main project folder), run the following commands to upload your entire project:
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin <Your_GitHub_Repository_URL>
    git push -u origin main
